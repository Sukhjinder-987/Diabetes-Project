# Diabetes-Project
The Diabetes Project aims to make the best of machine learning techniques and strategies to find whether a patient is diabetic, non-diabetic, or pre-diabetic based on features such as age range, hemoglobin, Urea, LDL, HDL, VLDL, BMI, Cholesterol, and TG. The project aims to understand the reason for the patient's diabetes make a prediction for the future from the given data using the different models and find which one is the best for the prediction.

Problem Statement:-
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide and requires early diagnosis to prevent complications. The project aims to develop a machine-learning predictive model that can classify patients as diabetic, non-diabetic, or pre-diabetic based on the features described in the dataset. The project seeks to identify the factors that are responsible for diabetes and improve the accuracy and reliability of prediction using different machine-learning models which will help healthcare professionals to make effective data-driven decisions for diabetes management.
